A wide range of vocabulary is used accurately and appropriately with very natural and sophisticated control of lexical features. Minor errors in spelling and word formation are extremely rare and have minimal impact on communication.",

    coherenceCohesion: "The message can be followed with ease. Information and ideas are logically sequenced, and cohesion is well managed. Occasional lapses in coherence or cohesion may occur. Paragraphing is used sufficiently and appropriately.",
    lexicalResource: "A wide resource is fluently and flexibly used to convey precise meanings within the scope of the task. There is skilful use of uncommon and/or idiomatic items when appropriate, despite occasional inaccuracies in word choice and collocation. Occasional errors in spelling and/or word formation may occur.",

    criterion1: "The response covers the requirements of the task. The content is relevant and accurate – there may be a few omissions or lapses. (Academic) Key features which are selected are covered and clearly highlighted. It presents a clear overview.",
    coherenceCohesion: "Information and ideas are logically organised and there is a clear progression throughout the response. A few lapses may occur. A range of cohesive devices including reference and substitution is used flexibly but with some inaccuracies.",
    lexicalResource: "The resource is sufficient to allow some flexibility and precision. There is some ability to use less common and/or idiomatic items. An awareness of style and collocation is evident, though inappropriacies occur. Only a few errors in spelling and/or word formation.",
    grammarAccuracy: "A variety of complex structures is used with some flexibility and accuracy. Grammar and punctuation are generally well controlled, and error-free sentences are frequent. A few errors in grammar may persist, but these do not impede communication."

    criterion1: "The response focuses on the requirements of the task and an appropriate format is used. (Academic) Key features are covered and adequately highlighted. A relevant overview is attempted. Information is appropriately selected and supported.",
    coherenceCohesion: "Information and ideas are generally arranged coherently and there is a clear overall progression. Cohesive devices are used to some good effect but cohesion within and/or between sentences may be faulty or mechanical.",
    lexicalResource: "The resource is generally adequate and appropriate for the task. The meaning is generally clear in spite of a rather restricted range or a lack of precision in word choice. Some errors in spelling and/or word formation, but these do not impede communication.",
    grammarAccuracy: "A mix of simple and complex sentence forms is used but flexibility is limited. Errors in grammar and punctuation occur, but rarely impede communication."

    band: 5,
    criterion1: "The response generally addresses the requirements of the task. The format may be inappropriate in places. (Academic) Key features are not adequately covered. The recounting of detail is mainly mechanical. There may be no data to support the description.",
    coherenceCohesion: "Organisation is evident but is not wholly logical and there may be a lack of overall progression. The relationship of ideas can be followed but the sentences are not fluently linked to each other. There may be limited/overuse of cohesive devices.",
    lexicalResource: "The resource is limited but minimally adequate for the task. Simple vocabulary may be used accurately but the range does not permit much variation in expression. Frequent lapses in the appropriacy of word choice.",
    grammarAccuracy: "The range of structures is limited and rather repetitive. Although complex sentences are attempted, they tend to be faulty. Grammatical errors may be frequent and cause some difficulty for the reader."
